# DaVinci Resolve Scripts

Here are some scrips I made for DaVinci Resolve.

For your info I use, DVR 16.2 with MacOS Mojave.

## CurrentTimelineItem Beat Marker

This script allow you to put marker automatically based on beats (it doesn't recognize the beat, you need to input it as variable).

To use it:
- copy the code into a text file
- change the configuration variables to your preferences
- open **Workspace** > **Console** in DVR **Edit Tab**
- Select **Py2** as interpreter
- Paste the modified code and hit Enter

>**If you use Windows** you need to uncommend the line 24 and comment the line 25

Exemple: it will make for a 4/4 tempo it will make 3 yellow marker and 1 red marker.
